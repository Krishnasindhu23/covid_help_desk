# Title : COVID HELP DESK

# Description: 
Of late, there has been growing anxiety on lack of beds in hospitals apart from that caused by covid itself. Taking this as the base, we have come up with a possible solution to tackle this situation through a web application called “ The Covid Help Desk.”
Covid Help Desk provides the list of hospitals and the availability of beds in them state-wise, country-wide. It allows the hospitals to update the changes in the number of beds time to time. User can also view the demand-supply gap state-wise.
Additionally, it also provides a list of measures and practices for Covid Home Management.
